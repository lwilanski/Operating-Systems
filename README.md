# Operating Systems

## Course Description
This repository contains all the source code for the weekly assignments of the Operating Systems course conducted at AGH University of Science and Technology. The course was structured around learning how to compile files, manage processes and threads, communicate between processes, handle signals, and work with files on a Linux operating system.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by weeks, each directory corresponding to a specific assignment given during the course. Inside each directory, you will find the source code files and any additional resources used or created during the development of the assignments. This repository also includes the assessment tests we took throughout the course to check our understanding and progress.
